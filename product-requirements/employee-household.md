/design-os:data-model An employee can belong to multiple households. When the user adds an  
  employee they are automatically added to the currently active / selected household of the   
  user. When adding an user we should also show the option of adding existing employee from   
  a different household that the user belongs to. That way the user would not have to type    
  in the same details over and over again  

  /design-os:data-model I also want an option to add employees that not on a monthly payroll  
  but are on an adhoc basis as well. By default we should always ask for monthly salary but   
  there should be an option to turn that off as well if the employee is of ad-hoc nature.     
  This should be household specific. Can you please see what changes are required here?
