/design-os:data-model An employee can belong to multiple households. When the user adds an  
  employee they are automatically added to the currently active / selected household of the   
  user. When adding an user we should also show the option of adding existing employee from   
  a different household that the user belongs to. That way the user would not have to type    
  in the same details over and over again
