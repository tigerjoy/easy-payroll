I employ work staff at my house like a cook, a maid and others whom I employ throughout the year. I want to create an app where I can add details of my empployee like photo, name, designation, contact details, address etc.

I would want to store the salary of each employee, and increments that they have received, advances they might have taken, any bonuses they have been awared basically a payroll system for them.

It should also support registering attendance, for the days that came and for the days that they didn't. It should support adding the holidays that each employee gets. For example, an employee is entitled to every Monday off, or every 4 days in a month off etc (similar to event occurrences of Google Calendar) we should be able to specify.

The employer should not be compelled to record attendance every day. If the day is not over then the app should not mark the employee as absent or present. If the day is over without any marking the app should automatically consider the employee to be marked present for the day. The employer / user can backdate and mark the employee absent or present at any time.

A settings page should be provided that allows the user to control these behavior which should always have a default.

A calendar view of the days the employee was absent or present when the employee was paid etc should be there.

This app should support user --> team --> organization so that members of a family can use this app and every one has
shared access.

All of the above should be inside the app shell.

There should also be a public facing URL that the employer / user should be able to share with the employee who can open that URL, enter just their phone number (that is in the system) and get a view only access to the days they have been paid,
the number of holidays they have used, are left, etc.

For the user there should be social auth present, but for the above link there needs to be nothing just enter phone number and the employee should be able to see their details etc.
