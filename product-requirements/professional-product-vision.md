## **Product Vision – Professional Version**

The product is a digital household workforce management and payroll platform designed for employers who manage domestic staff such as cooks, maids, drivers, caretakers, and other home-based employees.

The application will enable employers to maintain a structured and centralized record of each employee, including their photograph, full name, designation, contact details, residential address, and other relevant personal information.

The platform will function as a lightweight payroll system, allowing employers to record and manage employee compensation details, including base salary, periodic increments, advances taken, bonuses awarded, and other financial adjustments over time. This will create a transparent financial history for each employee.

The system will also support attendance management. Employers will be able to mark daily attendance, track absences, and define recurring holiday rules for each employee. These rules should be flexible and event-based, similar to recurrence patterns in tools like Google Calendar — for example, assigning every Monday as a weekly holiday, or allocating a fixed number of off-days per month.

To reduce manual burden, the application will not require the employer to mark attendance every day. If a day passes without explicit input, the system will automatically assume the employee was present by default. However, employers will retain the ability to retrospectively modify attendance records at any time by marking an employee as present or absent on past dates.

A configurable settings panel will be provided where users can customize attendance automation rules, defaults, and other behavioral preferences of the system.

The application will include a calendar-based view that visually represents employee attendance, absences, holidays, and payroll events such as salary payments.

From an access-control perspective, the platform will support a hierarchy of **User → Team → Organization**, enabling multiple family members or household stakeholders to share access to the same data while collaborating within a single household or organizational unit.

The application will offer secure social authentication for primary users (employers).

In addition, the platform will provide a public-facing employee portal accessible via a shareable URL. Employees will be able to visit this link, enter their registered phone number, and receive view-only access to their records, including:

* Payment history
* Holidays used
* Remaining holidays
* Attendance summary

This employee portal will not require any login credentials beyond phone number verification, ensuring simplicity and accessibility.
