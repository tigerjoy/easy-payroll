# HomeStaff

## Description
A digital household workforce management and payroll platform designed for employers to manage domestic staff. It simplifies tracking employee records, automates attendance with "present by default" logic, and maintains a transparent financial history of salaries, advances, and bonuses.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Disorganized Employee Records
Centralized digital profiles allow employers to maintain structured records including photos, contact details, roles, and residential addresses in one place.

### Problem 2: Tedious Attendance Tracking
The system uses "present by default" automation so employers only need to mark absences, while supporting flexible recurring holiday rules similar to calendar events.

### Problem 3: Complex Payroll & Advances
A lightweight payroll system tracks base salary, periodic increments, bonuses, and advances to create a transparent and accurate financial history for each employee.

### Problem 4: Lack of Transparency for Staff
A public-facing employee portal allows staff to view their payment history, holidays, and attendance summary simply by entering their registered phone number.

### Problem 5: Collaborative Management
A "User > Household" hierarchy enables multiple family members or stakeholders to share access and collaborate on managing the same household staff records.
